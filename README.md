We serve two endpoint, /get_token, which will provide a JWT, this endpoint expects and API_KEY header
```
curl -X POST -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: $KEY" $HOSTNAME/get_token 
```

The /DevOps endpoint provides the functionality for posting message and expect both the API_KEY and the JWT you can request at /get_token
```text
curl -X POST -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
-H "X-JWT-KWY: $TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "message": "This is a test","to": "Juan Perez","from": "Rita Asturia","timeToLifeSec": 45 }' \
$HOSTNAME/DevOps
```
Both endpoints will return an error if a method other that POST is used.
